      From years of experiences in facilitating our community to face urgent
      issues of the time, concerning it, we realized it is needed something new.
      Is it climate change, the loss of biodiversity, chances and risks of new
      technologies & digitization, health & food or equality, the understanding
      of living systems and their interaction with our surroundings became more
      and more important. 


      Hence, our answer was to design a place that offers an interactive
      environment and supports creativity & collaboration for actively framing a
      sustainable future within a bio based society. So we upgraded our
      [machBar-Potsdam (fabLab)](https://machbar-potsdam.de/) in Oct. 2018, with
      open bio-lab facilities, to cultivate organisms and grow own biological
      raw material, design bio-based ideas and build prototypes. 


      Our DIY bio-facilities @machBar are embedded into the community of a
      self-governed cultural center;
      [freiLand-Potsdam](https://www.freiland-potsdam.de/#). Here are acting
      more than 50 stakeholder on an areal of 12 000 square meters and 5
      buildings, which mission it is to empower young people to actively form a
      sustainable future.


      The NGO Science Shop Potsdam funded the machBar Potsdam fabLab in 2012
      @freiLand and is since then legally responsible for it. In addition the
      Science Shop acts as local network HUB for the freiLand community to
      regional partner in academia, tech, arts & economy (SME) as well as global
      networks for open science, open education & open innovation. Within a
      research project to regional strategies for bio based economy
      ([DiReBio](https://direbio.de/)) funded by the German Ministry for
      Education and Science (BMBF), the Science Shop Potsdam is partner with the
      University Potsdam and Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and
      Bioeconomy. Here we utilize the bio-lab facilities to include kids and
      young people in a future designing session for a regional bio-based
      economy.
