      From years of experiences in facilitating our community to face urgent
      issues of the time, concerning them, we realized it is needed something
      new. Is it climate change, the loss of biodiversity,chances and risks of
      new technologies & digitalization, health & food or equality, the
      understanding of living systems and their interaction with our
      sourroundings became more and more important. 


      Hence, designing a place that offers an interactive environment and
      supports creativity & collaboration for actively creating a sustainable
      future within a bio based society, was our answer. So we upgraded our
      machBar-Potsdam (fabLab), with open biolab facilities, to cultivate
      organisms and grow your own biological raw material, design your
      individual bio-based product and make IT.


      Our facilities are embedded into the community of a self-governed
      sozio-cultural youth center, called freiLand-Potsdam. Here cooperates more
      than 50 active stakeholder, which mission it is to empower young people to
      design a sustainable future.



       combining local expertise and global networks in a creative environment
